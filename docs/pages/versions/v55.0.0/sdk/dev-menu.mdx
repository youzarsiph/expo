The `expo-dev-menu` can be used as a **standalone library** in any Expo project. It is especially useful in [brownfield apps](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/brownfield/) that don't need the full [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/dev-client/) launcher interface.

`expo-dev-menu` provides a developer menu UI for React Native apps that includes:

- A powerful and extensible menu UI accessible via shake gesture or three-finger long press
- Quick access to common development actions
- Support for custom menu items to extend functionality

## Installation

<APIInstallSection />

## Usage

Once installed, the developer menu is available in your debug builds. You can open it by:

- **Shake gesture**: Shake your device
- **Three-finger long press**: Long press with three fingers on the screen
- **Programmatically**: Call `DevMenu.openMenu()` from your code

## Extending the dev menu

The dev menu can be extended to include extra buttons by using the `registerDevMenuItems` API:

```tsx
import { registerDevMenuItems } from 'expo-dev-menu';

const devMenuItems = [
  {
    name: 'My Custom Button',
    callback: () => console.log('Hello world!'),
  },
];

registerDevMenuItems(devMenuItems);
```

This will create a new section in the dev menu that includes the buttons you have registered:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="An example of a custom menu button in expo-dev-menu"
  src="/static/images/dev-client/custom-menu-button.png"
  className="max-w-[400px]"
/>

> **Note:** Subsequent calls of `registerDevMenuItems` will override all previous entries.

## Using with expo-dev-client

If you are using [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/), install `expo-dev-client` instead. It includes `expo-dev-menu` along with additional development tools:

- A configurable launcher UI for switching between development servers
- Improved debugging tools
- Support for loading updates from [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/)

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

For more information, check the [`expo-dev-client` reference](/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/).

## API

```js
import * as DevMenu from 'expo-dev-menu';
```

<APISection packageName={['expo-dev-menu']} apiName="DevMenu" />
